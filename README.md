# TTR-Popup
Popup by TTR is a great way to quickly visualize things that may be hard to remember by using images

## To Install:
```
mkdir -p ~/.scripts/TTR-Scripts/ && cd $_
git clone https://github.com/TheTechRun/TTR-Popup
chmod -R +x ~/.scripts/TTR-Scripts
```

## Pre-installed:
### The `launch.sh` in the Keyboard directory will launch the `mirayoku` and `RSTHD` Keyboard Layout images.
### The `launch.sh` in the Vim directory will launch the `Vim Motion` images. 


## Make Your Own:
### 1. Create a sub-directory.
Example:
`mkdir ~/.scripts/TTR-Scripts//TTR-Popup/Graphs/`

### 2. Add whatever images that you want to popup to that `Graph` directory. Remember that images are shown in numerical and Alphabetical order so be sure to name the images accordingly.

### 3. run the `generator.sh` script. This will create a `launch.sh` script in the new `Graph` directory. Now that script will launch the images in your `graph` directory. Scroll up and down or right and left. 

## BONUS:
### Map/Bind your `launch.sh` scripts to shortcut keys for quick access!
